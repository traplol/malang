# malang

First and foremost, this is just a place for me to try things and to learn about how one might implement 
a programming language.

malang is a general purpose, statically and strongly typed, structured programming language. It is early 
in development but already it features:

+ a tracing garbage collector
+ type inference
+ primitive types such as `string`, `int`, `bool`, `double`, `buffer`s, and arrays.
+ first class function expressions
+ block expressions
+ bound/named functions that support parameter overloading
+ extend any type with operators and methods
+ user-defined structures
+ strong type aliasing
+ a file-based module system

Planned features:

+ multiple return values
+ string interpolation
+ closures
+ zero overhead generics
+ traits
+ exceptions
+ optimized ahead of time compiliation that can be saved to disk and run at a later time.

malang is compiled into a fairly low-level stack-based bytecode which is then interpreted by the malangVM. 

## Building
There are plans to support and move towards CMake, but [tup](http://gittup.org/tup/) is the current build tool.

### Building on *nix

1. Make sure you have installed the dependencies:
  * `g++` 4.7 or later or `clang++` 3.x or later
  * `tup`
  * `git`

2. Build and run
  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/traplol/malang
  $ cd malang
  $ tup init
  $ tup
  $ ./mal -q examples/hello-world.ma
    hello world!
  ```

## Crash course

### Variables
Variables can be declared with their type, or the type may be entirely omitted if it can be immediately deduced.
```
x : int
x = 42
y : double = 123.45

PI := 3.14159
PI = 3.0             # compile error because ALL_CAPS signifies it is a constant

z := "hello world"

a : int = 1.5        # compile error without explicit cast

b := returns_int()

c := if true "yep" else "nope"
```

### Flow control
An if/else block may be used as a value if the last expression for both legs is not ```void```
```
# `and` and `&&` are the same and `or` and `||` are also the same
if one
    println("hello world")
else if two or three and four
    println("wat")
else if five || size && seven
    println("woo!")
else
    println("hmm")

x := if get_condition() "yes!" else "nope"


```

While loop
```
# poor man's for loop
i := 0
while i < n {
    do_thing(i)
    i += 1
}
```

For loops expect the thing being iterated to implement `fn current() -> T` and `fn move_next() -> bool` where 
`fn move_next() -> bool` returns `false` when there are no more iterations left. See [range.ma](lib/range.ma) 
for a trivial Range implementation
```
for Range(0, 10) {
    println(it) # `it'em is implied
}

# You may also name the item with the `for ident in ...` syntax
for i in Range(0, 10) {
    for j in Range(10, 20) {
        println(i * j)
    }
}
```


### Functions
Functions can be defined and bound to a name, assigned to a variable, or used as a value in an expression. The 
main difference between binding to a name and to a variable is a function bound to a name can share that name
with other bound functions if their parameter types differ.

See [BUILTINS](BUILTINS.md) for a list of builtin and always availble functions.

```
# Binds to 'hello' with with no parameters
fn hello() -> void {
    println("hello world")
}

# Binds to 'hello' with 1 parameter (int)
# notice the void return type has been ommitted/implied
fn hello(a: int) {
    hello()
    println(a)
}

min := fn(a: double, b: double) -> double {
    if a < b
        return a
    else
        return b
}

fib := fn(n: int) -> int {
   if n < 3 {
       return 1
   }
   else {
       # notice the use of 'recurse' because otherwise 'fib' could be redefined to another 
       # function with the same function signature and that one would get called instead.
       return recurse(n-1) + recurse(n-2)
   }
}

```

### Arrays and buffers
Arrays consist of values/references and `buffer`s are blocks of memory with byte-index ganularity.
Both are special because their `length`, `[]` and `[]=` properties are optimized into their
own respective malangVM instructions. Both are bounds checked but unchecked instructions do exist for
when the compiler can be certain an index cannot possibly be out of range.
```
n := 123
nums := [n]int  # dynamically allocate 123 uninitialized ints
i := 0
while i < nums.length {
    nums[i] = i * i
    i += 1
}

a_buf := buffer(128) # 128 byte buffer
i = 0
while i < a_buf.length {
    a_buf[i] = i
    i += 1
}
```

### User defined types

```
type D = {
    e := 0
    
    _private_var := "hello world"     # starts with _ so this is private in this context
    CONST_VAR := 99                   # ALL_CAPS so this is constant/readonly in this context
    public_var := true                # not _private or CONST to this is public
    _ANOTHER_CONST := 111             # _private and CONST
    
    new (e: int) {
        self.e = e
    }
}
# A, B, and C don't have a constructor that takes parameters so the default constrcutor
# is implied. In the future, types will also be order independent.
type C = {
    d := D(42)
}
type B = {
    c := C()
}
type A = {
    b := B()
}
a := A()
println(a.b.c.d.e)



type Vec3 = {
    x := 0.0
    y := 0.0
    z := 0.0

    # default, only necessary because we define another constructor
    new () {}  

    new (x: double, y: double, z: double) {
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z
    }

    fn * (scalar: double) -> Vec3 {
        # note the implicit resolution of x,y,z 
        return Vec3(x*scalar, y*scalar, z*scalar)
    }

    fn + (other: Vec3) -> Vec3 {
        # and here we can shadow fields of the same name but still access them with
        # the implicit "self" reference
        x := self.x + other.x
        y := self.y + other.y
        z := self.z + other.z
        return Vec3(x, y, z)
    }

    fn - (other: Vec3) -> Vec3 {
        x := self.x - other.x
        y := self.y - other.y
        z := self.z - other.z
        return Vec3(x, y, z)
    }
}

a := Vec3() # creates a Vec3 with the default constructor
a.x = 999.0
b := Vec3(1.5, 2.3, 3.14)
c := a + b
println(c.x) # 1000.5
println(c.y) # 2.3
println(c.z) # 3.14

```

### Strong type aliasing
Type aliasing is a way to distinguish types which have the same internal representation from each
other without unnecessary runtime overhead. Type aliasing also allows you to write extensions for
an aliased type separate from higher types and separate from any neighboring type aliases while
allowing these methods to be available to any sub-aliases.
See [alias.ma](examples/tests/alias.ma) for a more comprehensive example.

```
type alias cents   = int
type alias dollars = int
type alias time_ms = int

fn cents(d: dollars) -> cents {
    # `unalias' converts to the top type of an alias hierarchy: in this case `unalias(d)' is an `int'
    return unalias(d) * 100
}
fn dollars(c: cents) -> dollars {
    return unalias(c) / 100
}

money    : dollars = 45     # ok: 45
pennies  := cents(money)    # ok: 4500
duration : time_ms = 2750   # ok: 2750

#bad1 : cents = duration    # compile error, no conversion exists
#bad2 : dollars = duration  # compile error, no conversion exists
ok1   : dollars = 45         # 45 is an int which is the aliased type
ok2   : cents = 9999         # 9999 is an int which is the aliased type
#bad3 : cents = 42.69       # compile error, 42.69 is not an int
```

### Extensions
Extensions allow you to implement new methods and operators on any existing type but they do not
allow you to add more fields to them.
```
# string multiplication doesn't yet exist, so let us implement it
extend string {
    fn * (n: int) -> string {

        # edge case
        if n <= 0 {
            return string(buffer(0))
        }

        total_len := self.length * n
        tmp_buf := buffer(total_len)

        i := 0
        while n > 0 {
            k := 0
            while k < self.length {
                tmp_buf[i] = self[k]
                i += 1
                k += 1
            }
            n -= 1
        }

        return string(tmp_buf, total_len)
    }
}

println("hello " * 10) # hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello 
```
